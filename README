NAME
    Yada::Yada::Yada - defer coding to later

SYNOPSIS
      use Yada::Yada::Yada;

      if ($something_is_true) {
        ... # I'll fill this in later.
      }

DESCRIPTION
    For Perl 6 we've been promised a "yada yada yada" operator, which makes
    '...' valid syntax for "I'll fill this bit in later.", allowing the code
    to compile, but issue a run-time warning.

    But, like many of the other things that may or may not happen in Perl 6,
    we can already make this happen in Perl 5.

    All you need is to 'use Yada::Yada::Yada' and off you go ...
